Talk about your worries
It's normal to feel a bit worried or frustrated if you need to self-isolate. Remember: it's OK to share your concerns with others you trust â€“ opening up about the way you feel can really help.

If you cannot speak to someone you know or if doing so has not helped, there are plenty of helplines you can try instead.
