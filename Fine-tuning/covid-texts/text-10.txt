Get your information from the right sources
Lots of conflicting and confusing information about COVID-19 can make it harder to know what to do or believe.

If you are finding news and information about COVID-19 overwhelming or worrying, try to limit how much you consume. Stick to trusted sources like GOV.UK and the NHS COVID-19 pages for the most up-to-date information.
