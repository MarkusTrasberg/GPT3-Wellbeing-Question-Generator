Recognise your achievements
It's been a really difficult time, and many of us have been tested in ways we never expected. We have all had to find new ways to cope and adapt.

Take 10 minutes and list some of your accomplishments or successes from the past 12 months â€“ no matter how big or small. Are there any unexpected ones in there?

Perhaps you learned how to cook a new meal, organised the "cupboard of doom", home-schooled the kids, led a virtual meeting, helped a friend or neighbour, finished a book you've been meaning to read, or spoke to friends and family more.

Even just getting by in the face of one of the biggest challenges the world has faced in many years is a big achievement in itself.

Whatever they are, take time to reflect on and be proud of your accomplishments this year, and keep a note of them from now on.
