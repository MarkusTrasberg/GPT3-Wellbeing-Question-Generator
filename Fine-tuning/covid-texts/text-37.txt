7. Do things you enjoy
Feeling worried, anxious or low might stop us doing things we usually enjoy, but focusing on your favourite hobby, relaxing or connecting with others can help with anxious thoughts and feelings.

If you do not have any hobbies right now, think about trying something new. There are lots of free tutorials and courses online, or you could join a new club.
