1. Listen to what your child says and how they're feeling Children and young people may respond to stress in different ways. They may be more emotional (upset, anxious or angry) or behave differently (clingy, withdrawn or wet the bed). They may also have physical symptoms, like stomach ache, and problems sleeping. Children and young people can feel less anxious if they are able to express themselves in a safe and supportive environment. Stay calm â€“ kids often take their emotional cues from the adults in their lives, so how you respond is important. Listen to and acknowledge their concerns, speak kindly to them and answer any questions they have honestly. Give them extra love and attention if they need it.
