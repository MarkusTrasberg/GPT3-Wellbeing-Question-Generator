2. Do not avoid things entirely
Avoiding the things that make us anxious can sometimes feel like the easier option in the short term, but this can make it harder to start facing our fears in the longer term. Instead, try to set yourself small but manageable targets. Start with activities that are important to you and feel achievable – like meeting close friends and family for a coffee or snack outside – and gradually build up from there.

It can help to confide in a friend or family member so they can support you to overcome your anxieties.
