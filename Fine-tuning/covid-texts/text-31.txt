9 tips to help if you are worried about COVID-19
Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected us all in different ways, and it's been a worrying time for lots of us. As the situation changes, you might feel nervous about the future or frustrated by the way your life has changed.

It's important to remember it's OK to feel this way and that everyone reacts differently. For most of us, these difficult feelings will pass.

There are simple things we can do to help manage the way we feel, and take care of our mental health and wellbeing.

1. Stay connected with people
Maintaining healthy relationships with people we trust is important for our mental wellbeing. We all need to feel connected, so keep in touch – whether it's with people you see often or reconnecting with old friends.

There are lots of different ways to connect. You could schedule time each week to meet in person, speak over the phone or make time for regular video calls.

Social media is another good way to stay connected, but make sure you take regular breaks from your devices – and switch off before bed.
