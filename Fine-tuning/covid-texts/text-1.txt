2. Be clear about what's happening Children and young people want to feel that those who care for them can keep them safe. Explain what will help to keep them and those they love safe, such as washing their hands regularly. Do this by talking openly and giving honest answers to questions they have. Use reliable sources of information , like the coronavirus advice on GOV.UK and NHS coronavirus advice â€“ and explain things in words they understand. If you cannot answer all their questions or stop them from worrying, focus on listening to their feelings. This will help them feel supported.
