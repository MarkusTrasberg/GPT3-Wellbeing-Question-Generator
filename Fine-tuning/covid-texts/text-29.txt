Decide what strategies work for you
Uncertainty at work, home or around others' expectations can put a strain on our mental health and wellbeing.

Although it might feel overwhelming, remember this is not the first challenge you have faced in life. You probably already have a lot of the strengths and skills to get through the current situation.

Think about what strategies have worked best for you when you have faced problems before, and work out how you can use these approaches now. It could be in the past or something that has worked recently.

Maybe you've noticed going for a walk at lunch every day helps to clear your head or perhaps scheduling a catch-up with a friend makes you feel that bit brighter.

Whatever it is, commit to making it part of your daily routine â€“ and remember that recognising when you need professional help with your mental health is an important coping strategy for many people.
