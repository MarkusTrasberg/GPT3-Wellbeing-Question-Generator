3. Acknowledge what's working
Even when it might feel like everything is up in the air or going wrong, there will be some things, however small, that do not change. It could be a close relationship, our favourite meal or a song that means something to us.

Noticing, acknowledging and being grateful for these constants in our life, as well as any small positive changes we have already made or are working on, can really help us deflect and recover from life's knocks â€“ and helps us see positive possibilities for the future.

Each day, consider what went well and try to list 3 things you're thankful for.
