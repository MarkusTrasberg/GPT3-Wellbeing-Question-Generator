3. Limit news and conversation about COVID-19 Children and young people are likely to have been exposed to lots of news about COVID-19 in the media and online. This can become worrying or overwhelming, just like it can for adults. Blocking all news rarely helps, as children are likely to find things out from their friends or online. And turning off the TV or closing websites when children come into the room may increase their interest, and their imagination, too much. Stay informed and up to date but think about setting a limit on how much COVID-19 news and talk you and your family have. Discuss what's going on with them and ask what they have heard, to check understanding and provide reassurance where necessary.
