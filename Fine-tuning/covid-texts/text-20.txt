Carry on doing things you enjoy
If you are self-isolating it may be easy to neglect the things you usually enjoy doing, but this can lead to feeling bored, frustrated or low.

Make an effort to focus on your favourite hobby if it's something you can still do at home. Or give something new a go: read, write, do crosswords or jigsaws, bake, or try drawing and painting. Whatever it is, find something that works for you.

If you cannot think of anything you like doing, try learning something new at home. There are lots of free tutorials and courses online.
