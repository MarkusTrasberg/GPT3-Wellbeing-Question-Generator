It may have been harder to be consistent since the COVID-19 outbreak, but sticking to a routine can be really helpful and make children and young people feel safer. Think about how to develop a routine that covers the basics but is interesting and fun too. Make sure that every day or week includes time for learning, playing and relaxing. You could also arrange play dates with friends. Spending time outside in nature is another great way to take care of mental wellbeing. It can be as simple as going for a weekend walk or doing the gardening together.
