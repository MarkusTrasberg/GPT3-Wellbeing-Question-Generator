Look after your body
Our physical health has a big impact on our mental wellbeing. If we are not feeling good, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour that end up making us feel worse.

Try to eat well-balanced meals, drink enough water and exercise regularly. Avoid smoking or drugs, and try not to drink too much alcohol.

Going for a walk, run or bike ride can really help lift your mood and clear your mind â€“ or you could try an easy 10-minute home workout.
