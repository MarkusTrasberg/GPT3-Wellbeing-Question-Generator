Try to stay in the moment
When going through a period of change and uncertainty, we can sometimes forget about the here and now.

It's important not to dwell on the past, fixate on the future, or get bogged down by things you do not or cannot know. You can only do your best with what you have today.

Relaxation, mindfulness or getting outside and enjoying nature are all good ways to help you focus on the present.Ã¤
