Only do what's comfortable
As the situation evolves, it's important to make sure we are going at our own pace.

We should not let others pressure us into things that make us feel uncomfortable, anxious or unsafe â€“ but we also have to try to not let that be an excuse that stops us from doing positive and beneficial things, like staying in touch with friends.

Discuss any concerns with those close to you and try to build in small positive changes. Honest and open communication is vital but so is giving others the space to move at their own speed.
