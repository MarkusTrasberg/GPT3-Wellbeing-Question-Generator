2. Focus on the short term
The further we look into the future, the easier it is to get overwhelmed by long-term uncertainty. Instead, try to focus on the day-to-day, and think about what's in your power to do right now.

Decide what's important to you, and concentrate on your short-term needs and those of the people close to you. Try breaking down each day or each week into manageable, achievable tasks, and focus on each goal in turn.

This can be hard if you are feeling low. Start with easier activities and work up â€“ as you progress, your mood should improve and it should get a bit easier.
