Reframe your thoughts
In difficult times, it can be easy to get caught up in negative thoughts, feelings and actions. For most people, feeling uneasy is an understandable response to the uncertainty present in everyday life, but there are ways to manage these feelings.

This will not resolve the problems you face but can help break a negative spiral and give you a new perspective â€“ things are often not as bad as we thought.
