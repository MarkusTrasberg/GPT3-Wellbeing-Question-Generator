2. Talk about your worries
The COVID-19 outbreak is unlike anything we have experienced before, and it's normal if you have felt worried, scared or helpless.

Remember: it's OK to share your concerns with others you trust â€“ and doing so may help them too.

If you cannot speak to someone you know or if doing so has not helped, there are plenty of helplines you can try instead.
