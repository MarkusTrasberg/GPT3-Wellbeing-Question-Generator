3. Support and help others
Helping someone else can benefit you as well as them. Having an understanding of other people's concerns, worries or behaviour is a great way to show your support.

Try to think of things you can do to help those around you. Is there a friend or family member nearby you could regularly check in with? If you're not local to them, try phoning or messaging instead.
