How to deal with change and uncertainty during COVID-19
We have all faced disruption and change during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and you may like the uncertainty has had a lasting impact.

It's easy to get caught in a spiral of "what ifs" â€“ worrying about the future and what to expect, particularly if we are already struggling with our mental health.

But there are ways we can manage uncertainty to help us reduce stress and cope better.

Here are 10 things you can do to help deal with change and look after your mental wellbeing in the face of uncertainty, as well as places you can go to get further free advice and support.

1. Take stock of how you feel
Put time aside to examine your current situation and consider how you really feel, perhaps talking it through with someone you trust.

Sometimes, just acknowledging the things that are affecting you can help you to manage feelings of uncertainty.

Try to be kind to yourself, and get support with how you are feeling if you think you might need it. There is plenty of help out there from mental health charities and the NHS.
