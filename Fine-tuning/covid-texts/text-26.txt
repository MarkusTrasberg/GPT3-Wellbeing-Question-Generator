Find a new rhythm
Routine and structure can be a powerful way to regain consistency and reduce uncertainty.

Think about all the day-to-day things that are within your control. How can you create a new routine that works for you? It can be as simple as going for a morning walk each day and sticking to the same bedtime.

Make time to de-stress and wind down each day â€“ build in positive activities like exercise, relaxation, hobbies, speaking to friends or spending time with those close to you, and think about a positive sleep routine.
