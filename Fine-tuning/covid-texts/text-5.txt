Get active Children and young people should be active for 60 minutes a day, with at least 30 minutes of this happening outside school, so it's important to try to build activity into kids' daily routine. There are lots of different ways to get active so try a few different things to see what they enjoy most. It might be swimming, dancing or running. This is also a good way to boost time outdoors â€“ you could try taking a football to a park, for instance.
