9. Look after your sleep
Good-quality sleep makes a big difference to how we feel mentally and physically, so it's important to get enough.

Try to maintain regular sleeping patterns and keep up good sleep hygiene practices â€“ like avoiding screens before bed, cutting back on caffeine and creating a restful environment. See our sleep page for more advice.
