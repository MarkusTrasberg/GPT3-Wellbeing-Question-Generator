 Stick to the facts
There is still lots of information circulating about COVID-19, but sometimes this might feel overwhelming or conflicting.

Find a credible source you can trust – such as GOV.UK or the NHS website – and fact-check information you get from newsfeeds, social media or other people.

Think about how inaccurate information could potentially affect others too, and try not to share anything without fact-checking against credible sources.

You might also want to consider limiting the time you spend watching, reading or listening to news and information about COVID-19, including on social media.
