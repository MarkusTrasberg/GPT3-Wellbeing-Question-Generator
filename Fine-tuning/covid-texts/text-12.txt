Make time to relax
Being able to see more of our friends and family and visit places is exciting. But it can also be a lot to take in all at once, so it's important to find regular time for yourself to relax too.

Many people find it helpful to spend time outside. Whether it's gardening or taking a walk in a local park, being in green space can help to lift your mood and relieve stress.
