4. Keep close and regular contact Staying connected and close to loved ones is important at every stage of life, so try to keep your children close to you or those that care for them. If you are not living with your children or have to go away, for work or to hospital, stay in touch regularly by phone or video calls. If the children are part of a family that is separated, it's important for them to be supported in their contact with parents and other family members â€“ even when the adults do not always get on. Make sure they have lots of opportunities to spend quality time with family members and carers. Lots of change or uncertainty can be confusing for children and young people. When talking with them, use simple terms they understand so it's clear why things are happening.
