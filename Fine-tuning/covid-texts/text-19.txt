Do not stay glued to the news
If you are staying at home, it might feel tempting to spend lot of time scrolling through social media and the news.

If this leads to difficult feelings, try to avoid paying attention to things that makes you feel worried or left out – focus on positive distractions instead.

Always use trustworthy sources – such as GOV.UK or the NHS website – and fact-check information from the news, social media or other people.
