Discuss any changes with others
Before socialising with others, talk about the situation with them to make sure everybody is on the same page about what feels comfortable.

If you live with other people, it's a good idea to talk to them about changes to restrictions as well. Being aware of everybody's fears and expectations can help to avoid conflict.

If the changes to restrictions have put pressure on your family, help for parents is available.
