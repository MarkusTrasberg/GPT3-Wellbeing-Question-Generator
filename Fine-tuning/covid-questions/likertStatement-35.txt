I feel overwhelmed by the conflicting information about Covid-19.

I trust the NHS website as a credible source of information about Covid-19.

I am careful to fact-check information I receive about Covid-19 before sharing it with others.

I limit the time I spend watching, reading or listening to news and information about Covid-19.
