I feel anxious about meeting close friends and family for a coffee or snack outside.

I feel like avoiding the things that make me anxious is the easier option in the short term.

I am trying to set myself small but manageable targets.

I have started with activities that are important to me and feel achievable.

I am gradually building up from there.

I have confided in a friend or family member so they can support me to overcome my anxiety.
